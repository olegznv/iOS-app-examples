# iOS app examples

This repo is a portfolio to showcase my development experience. It contains two simple applications:

* "Guess the Flag" is a guessing game: you are given a flag and have to guess which country it belongs to.

* "Length Converter" allows you to convert length values from the metric system to the imperial system and vice versa.
