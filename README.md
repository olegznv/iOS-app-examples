# iOS App Examples

This repo is a portfolio to showcase my development experience. It contains two simple applications:

- **Guess the Flag** is a game: you are given a flag and have to guess which country it belongs to.

- **Length Converter** allows you to convert length values from the metric system to the imperial system and vice versa.
