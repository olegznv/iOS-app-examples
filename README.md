# iOS App Examples

This repo is a portfolio to showcase my development experience. It contains two simple applications:

- **Guess the Flag** is a game: you are given a flag and have to guess which country it belongs to.

- **Length Converter** allows you to convert length values from the metric system to the imperial system and vice versa.

P.S.: Paul Hudson's [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) is a well-structured, easy-to-digest, and free course. Highly recommend it.
